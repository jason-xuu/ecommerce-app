Key Types of Data to Track
For a clothing store, we need to track several core types of data:

Users (Customers, Admins, Vendors)
Data related to different types of users visiting and managing the site.

Products
Data about clothing items, including sizes, colors, materials, and categories.

Categories
Organizing products into logical groups like shirts, pants, shoes, accessories, etc.

Inventory
Information about stock levels and suppliers of clothing items.

Orders
Data about customer orders, including products purchased, quantities, and shipping information.

Shopping Cart
Temporary data about products added to a cart before checkout.

Product Customizations
Allowing customers to customize items, such as color, size, or text (e.g., adding a monogram).

Reviews and Ratings
Customer feedback and ratings for clothing items.

Payments
Information on how customers pay for their orders (e.g., credit card, PayPal).

Discounts and Promotions
Data on promotional codes, seasonal discounts, and bulk purchase incentives.
